Proposed Approaches: Convolutional Neural Networks, Spatial Reinforcement Learning

A Machine Learning-Based Approach for Wildfire Susceptibility Mapping. The Case Study of the Liguria Region in Italy 
Deals with using ML to predict land cover/vegetation and model wildfires based on what the land is like

Forest Fire Susceptibility Modeling Using a Convolutional Neural Network for Yunnan Province of China
Basically asserts that CNNs are more accurate than random forests (used above)
